# Dead in Thay maps

This is a set of maps I created for Dead in Thay, as the maps provided by
Wizards aren't very useful for Foundry VTT.

All maps are set as "public" and available in [DungeonFog](https://www.dungeonfog.com/platform/public-maps/)
- This mod's version of Flesh Golem Laboratories was created using assets from
  [Forgotten Adventures](www.forgotten-adventures.net)
	- I do not have permission to redistribute assets from Forgotten Adventures
	- Therefore the public DungeonFog version does not have those assets.
